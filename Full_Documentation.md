# Full Documentation – CyberCrack

## 1. Introduction
CyberCrack is a red team simulation toolkit designed for cybersecurity beginners. It provides 15 CTF-style levels that simulate real-world ethical hacking scenarios in a safe Linux environment.

## 2. Problem Statement
Lack of beginner-friendly platforms for learning ethical hacking and cybersecurity hands-on. Existing platforms require advanced knowledge or internet access, limiting accessibility.

## 3. Objectives
- Provide hands-on ethical hacking training
- Simulate real-world attack vectors
- Design beginner-friendly Red Team CTF challenges
- Operate offline in a secure local environment

## 4. Literature Survey
- OverTheWire’s Krypton, Leviathan, and Natas
- TryHackMe and HackTheBox CTFs
- Linux system permissions and basic cryptography
- Network enumeration tools and techniques

## 5. System Requirements
- Ubuntu/Kali Linux
- bash, netcat, ssh, base64, Burp Suite, etc.
- RAM: Minimum 2 GB
- Python (optional)

## 6. System Design
- 15 level directories, each with its own challenge
- Central script (`setup.sh`) to configure environment
- User navigates and solves one level to access the next
- AI-generated challenge elements (binary, encoded, hidden files)

## 7. Implementation
Each level contains:
- `README.md` with hints
- Hidden flag or challenge file
- Solution based on Linux commands, decoding, scanning, etc.

## 8. Screenshots and Sample Output
Include images from `demo/screenshots/`:
```
Level 1:
Command: cat .hidden_flag
Output: CyberCrack{First_Flag_Found}
```

## 9. Challenges and Limitations
- No web GUI yet
- Some levels may require manual reset
- Requires basic Linux familiarity

## 10. Future Scope
- Add Blue Team defense simulation
- Host a scoreboard
- Web-based GUI using Flask/React
- Advanced encryption and AI-generated scripts

## 11. Conclusion
CyberCrack serves as a foundational tool for ethical hacking practice. It bridges the gap between theory and hands-on experience, making it ideal for students, security interns, and beginners.
