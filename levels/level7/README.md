# Level 7 - Hidden Whispers

*Objective:*  
The flag is hidden inside a file that appears to be ordinary. Your job is to dig into the details and uncover it.

*Scenario:*  
You've received a help file (manual.txt) that seems harmless. But legends say secrets are whispered in the comments...

*Hints:*
- Comments are usually lines that start with #.
- Use cat, less, or grep to inspect files closely.
- Look for anything that doesn’t appear when scanning quickly.

*Tools You Might Use:*
- cat manual.txt
- grep '#' manual.txt
- less or more

*Challenge Rating:*  
Easy

Remember: Sometimes, what’s hidden is more powerful than what’s shown.
