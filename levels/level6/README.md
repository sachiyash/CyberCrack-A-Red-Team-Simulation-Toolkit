# Level 6 - The Linked Illusion

*Objective:*  
Your mission is to retrieve the correct flag. But beware — not all flags are what they appear to be.

*Scenario:*  
You've entered a system that uses symbolic links to mislead intruders. There's a flag.txt file in plain sight, but is it really what you're looking for?

*Clues:*
- A symbolic link is just a pointer. Is it pointing to the truth?
- Explore the metadata or use ls -l and readlink to investigate deeper.
- Use commands like cat, ls, file, and readlink wisely.

*Rules:*
- Don't delete or rename files.
- You may use any Linux CLI tools to inspect files and symbolic links.

*Pro Tip:*  
True hackers look behind the obvious.

*Challenge Rating:*  
Intermediate

Good luck, and don’t get fooled by the link!
